# Agent Work Log

This file is for handoff between agents. Keep entries concise, factual, and newest-first.

## Current Project Context

- Repository: `/home/server/htdocs/mthan/vps`
- Product: MThan VPS, a Go API with a React/TypeScript client.
- Backend areas:
  - `main.go`: Go service entrypoint.
  - `routes/`: HTTP route registration.
  - `routes/api/`: public API routes.
  - `routes/post/`: root-only localhost/internal POST routes.
  - `services/`: business logic, router, auth, filesystem, health, root, and Linux user services.
- Frontend areas:
  - `client/src/`: React/TypeScript source.
  - `client/build/`: built static client assets.
- Common validation:
  - `make test`
  - `make fmt`
  - `make build`
  - `cd client && npm run build`

## Work Entries

### 2026-07-23 - Separate user and root portals

- Goal: Serve regular-user access at `/` and reserve `/root` for the fixed root account.
- Files changed: dual client runtimes and React basename, mode-specific login state/redirects, user terminal endpoint, session-owned shell selection, global POST root-session enforcement, user login rules, and work log.
- Important decisions: `/root` uses only UID 0 sessions; `/` accepts any authenticated non-root Linux account; user terminals ignore client-selected usernames and run as the session owner; all privileged `/post/*` routes require a root session except the explicit login/health handshakes.
- Validation: Go formatting, full Go test suite, TypeScript production build, application/control binary build, and `git diff --check`; frontend build has only pre-existing lint warnings.

### 2026-07-23 - Prevent regular-user root sessions

- Goal: Prevent a regular Linux account authenticated through the root login endpoint from receiving root terminal and control-panel access.
- Files changed: root login UID enforcement, session mode/UID invariants, terminal defense-in-depth check, session regression tests, and work log.
- Important decisions: root sessions require UID 0 and user sessions reject UID 0; previously persisted inconsistent sessions are invalidated when accessed.
- Validation: Go formatting, full Go test suite, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Caddy-only VHosts inventory

- Goal: Make the VHosts sidebar destination list the public hosts configured in Caddy.
- Files changed: Caddy-only discovery, root POST vhost endpoints, live VHosts page, removed placeholder root/user tables, and work log.
- Important decisions: Nginx and Apache parser helpers remain tested but are no longer discovery sources; root uses `/post/vhost/*`, users use `/api/vhost/*`; the page is read-only and reflects the adapted Caddyfile.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, production client build, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Caddy as required public server

- Goal: Make Caddy the standard public web server for ports 80 and 443 and install it with the panel.
- Files changed: installer package setup/service enablement, system app detection/install plans/tests, settings catalog/header validation, Caddy global config editor, port ownership display, and work log.
- Important decisions: the installer uses Caddy's official Debian/COPR packages or the Arch package and fails if Caddy cannot be installed/started; Nginx no longer claims the public ports in Apps; Caddyfile is an allowlisted editable global config.
- Validation: shell syntax, Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, production client build, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Route groups limited to API and POST

- Goal: Keep every HTTP handler under the actual `/api` or `/post` route group.
- Files changed: API/Post settings handlers, shared settings validation service, route imports, removed shared routes/settings handler, and work log.
- Important decisions: `routes/` now contains only the root registrar plus `api/` and `post/`; setting validation belongs to services rather than a third route namespace.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, route-tree scan, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Apps moved into Settings

- Goal: Make system apps sub-items of Apps Settings with route-backed detail pages.
- Files changed: shared Settings sidebar/app catalog, Settings and Apps layouts, route table, global sidebar/header links, User Overview links, and work log.
- Important decisions: the top-level Apps navigation and `/apps/*` routes are removed; app details use `/settings/apps/:appname`; `/settings/apps` remains the installed/header shortcut overview.
- Validation: TypeScript type-check, production client build, route reference scan, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Container Dockerfile editor

- Goal: Edit the host Dockerfile associated with a listed Docker or Podman container.
- Files changed: safe Dockerfile discovery/read/write service, root/user routes, Containers action/modal, and work log.
- Important decisions: discovery uses `mthan.dockerfile` then Compose working-directory metadata; rootless Podman paths are jailed to the owner's home; only existing regular files up to 2 MiB are editable; saving never rebuilds or recreates a container.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, production client build, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Per-user cPanel access status

- Goal: Show whether each Linux user can authenticate with cPanel and activate access by setting a password.
- Files changed: shadow-derived access status service/tests, user list response, root-only password route, User Details status/actions/modal, and work log.
- Important decisions: password hashes never leave the server; empty/locked password entries disable cPanel access; activation validates the selected home user and sets its Linux password through argument-safe `chpasswd` input.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, production client build, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Container controls and logs

- Goal: Operate containers and inspect recent logs from the Containers inventory.
- Files changed: owner-aware container command service, root/user action and logs routes, Containers controls/modal, and work log.
- Important decisions: actions are limited to start/stop/restart; IDs and engines are validated; rootless Podman commands execute as the owning Linux user; logs are capped at the latest 200 lines.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, production client build, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Editable container-engine configuration

- Goal: Make Docker and Podman global configuration paths directly editable from Apps.
- Files changed: allowlisted atomic config file service/tests, root-only GET/PUT route, Apps configuration cards/modal, and work log.
- Important decisions: only explicit Docker/Podman system paths are accepted; JSON is validated; symlinks/non-regular targets and files over 2 MiB are rejected; saving never restarts an engine automatically.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, production client build, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Consistent user list route

- Goal: Keep root Linux-user actions under one `/post/user/*` namespace.
- Files changed: user list handler location, POST route registration, Users client, and work log.
- Important decisions: `/post/users` is replaced by `/post/user/list` without a legacy alias.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Containers inventory page

- Goal: Separate global container-engine configuration from the operational list of containers.
- Files changed: container discovery service, separate root POST and user API handlers, sidebar/router/API map, Containers page, tests, and work log.
- Important decisions: root sees system Docker plus rootless Podman containers grouped by Linux owner; non-root sessions see only their own Podman inventory; listing commands are fixed and Podman executes under the owning user without a shared socket.
- Validation: Go formatting/tests, TypeScript type-check, production client build, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Virtual host discovery API

- Goal: Expose public web-server ownership and virtual-host discovery under `/api/vhost`.
- Files changed: vhost discovery service/parser, authenticated API routes/tests, and work log.
- Important decisions: port ownership comes from listening processes; Nginx, Caddy, and Apache use their native configuration dump/adaptation commands; hostname lookup never reaches a shell command; all vhost endpoints require a valid session.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted tests, full Go tests, and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-20 - Container engine configuration and header layout

- Goal: Place pinned app shortcuts on the left, improve App Details fields, and add Docker/Podman configuration pages.
- Files changed: header layout, Apps details, and work log.
- Important decisions: shortcuts now follow the app title; App Details omits Port for apps without a fixed network port; Docker remains system-managed while Podman is explicitly rootless and isolated per Linux user, with no shared root service/socket controls.
- Validation: TypeScript type-check and `git diff --check`.

### 2026-07-17 - Restore system Node.js 22

- Goal: Restore Node.js as a system app and make Node.js 22 the default installation target.
- Files changed: app detection/install plans and tests, Apps/User Overview/Settings/Header UI, settings validation, and work log.
- Important decisions: Debian/RHEL families configure the fixed NodeSource 22.x repository before package installation; Arch installs `nodejs-lts-jod`; Node.js is again detectable, installable, and pinnable.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: existing non-22 Node.js installations are reported as installed and are not automatically replaced.

### 2026-07-17 - Remove system Node.js app

- Goal: Remove Node.js from system Apps because Node versions will be managed per Linux user through NVM.
- Files changed: app detection/install plans and tests, Apps/User Overview/Settings/Header UI, settings validation and stale header-pin cleanup, and work log.
- Important decisions: Node.js is no longer detected, installable, pinnable, or displayed as a system app; existing `node` header pins are removed when settings load.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: per-user NVM management is not implemented yet.

### 2026-07-17 - System app installation

- Goal: Install supported apps directly from `/apps` and simplify app display names.
- Files changed: package installation service/tests, authenticated Apps POST route, Apps UI, and work log.
- Important decisions: package names and command arguments are allowlisted for apt, dnf/yum, and pacman families; installation status and detected version refresh from the existing Apps API; display names are concise product names.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: third-party repositories such as Docker CE must already be configured when distro-native fallback packages are unavailable.

### 2026-07-17 - Add user app by upload or Git

- Goal: Add apps to a user's `htdocs` folder from a ZIP upload or Git repository.
- Files changed: user app service and route, route registration, Users Apps UI, and work log.
- Important decisions: app names are restricted; destinations must not already exist; ZIP traversal and symlinks are rejected; Git clone uses argument-safe execution; created files are owned by the target Linux user.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - API credential management

- Goal: Implement the APIs page and persistent `apis` SQLite table, including accepted IP restrictions.
- Files changed: settings database migration, API credential service/tests, authenticated root routes, APIs page, and work log.
- Important decisions: secrets are returned once and only SHA-256 hashes are stored; accepted IPs are stored as a JSON array and validated as IP addresses or CIDR ranges; an empty list allows all IPs; keys can be enabled, disabled, edited, and deleted.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: API key authentication for product endpoints is not implemented yet.

### 2026-07-17 - APIs sidebar item

- Goal: Add APIs navigation immediately above Settings in the global sidebar.
- Files changed: sidebar, React route table, APIs placeholder route, and work log.
- Important decisions: `/apis` is a real React Router destination with an English Coming soon state, avoiding a dead navigation item.
- Validation: TypeScript type-check and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: API management functionality is not implemented yet.

### 2026-07-17 - User overview system app status

- Goal: Show installation and version information from the system Apps route in User Overview.
- Files changed: app detection service/tests, system Apps route client merge, Users Overview UI, and work log.
- Important decisions: `/post/apps` is the single source for both views; versions are detected from installed binaries across supported distros; PHP reports all detected versions; User Overview links each item to its `/apps/{app}` route.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - User app directory listing

- Goal: List a user's apps from the direct child directories of their `htdocs` folder.
- Files changed: Linux user service/tests, root-only user apps route registration and handler, Users UI, and work log.
- Important decisions: only immediate directories under `<home>/htdocs` are returned; regular files and nested descendants are excluded; usernames resolve through the existing `/home` user list instead of becoming raw filesystem paths; each app renders as an expandable accordion item ready for additional details and configuration.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - User home folder provisioning

- Goal: Simplify the temporary User Overview and provision standard folders for every new Linux user.
- Files changed: Users route, Linux user service and test, user creation route, and work log.
- Important decisions: Overview shows an English Coming soon state; the user-type badge was replaced by compact UID, Home, and Shell boxes on the same row as the username; new homes always contain `backup`, `logs`, `data`, `htdocs`, and `config`; home and child ownership use the created user's UID/GID; failed provisioning rolls back the account.
- Validation: Go formatting, targeted Go tests, TypeScript type-check, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Global multi-tab terminal

- Goal: Use one persistent terminal panel for root and all user shells across the app.
- Files changed: terminal context, Main, Dashboard layout, Terminal panel, Users route, and work log.
- Important decisions: terminal provider lives above routes; main sidebar activates the root tab; a user's Terminal action adds a `su -` tab; hiding or navigating does not destroy terminal tabs/sessions after first mount.
- Validation: TypeScript type-check, targeted Go tests, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - React Router migration

- Goal: Replace manual pathname routing and full-page nested navigation with React Router.
- Files changed: package manifests, Main, route table, sidebar/header navigation, Apps, Settings, Users, and work log.
- Important decisions: use `react-router-dom` v6; nested app/settings/user URLs use params; internal navigation uses Link/useNavigate; Back/Forward is router-managed.
- Validation: TypeScript type-check and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: top-level pages still own their DashboardLayout instances, but nested navigation no longer remounts the document/sidebar.

### 2026-07-17 - Per-user terminal section

- Goal: Add a Terminal sub-item for every Linux user.
- Files changed: terminal WebSocket backend/component, Users route, and work log.
- Important decisions: route is `/users/{username}/terminal`; root sessions launch `su - <username>` using a separate command argument; login shell starts in the target user's home; non-root sessions and unknown accounts are rejected.
- Validation: targeted Go tests, TypeScript syntax parser, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: folder-only `/home` entries without a matching system account cannot open a terminal.

### 2026-07-17 - Preserve sessions through update restarts

- Goal: Prevent transient 502/network failures during update from logging the user out.
- Files changed: user context, Login route, and work log.
- Important decisions: only HTTP 401 invalidates local login state; network/5xx preserves it while protected APIs remain server-validated; login distinguishes invalid credentials from temporary server failures and never renders proxy HTML.
- Validation: TypeScript syntax parser and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Suppress transient update gateway errors

- Goal: Do not show harmless 502/503/504 or network errors while the API is restarting.
- Files changed: update header component and work log.
- Important decisions: background check errors are suppressed during the update/reconnect workflow; post-reconnect confirmation failures remain visible.
- Validation: TypeScript syntax parser and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Nested user sections

- Goal: Add Overview, Files, and Apps sub-items for every user.
- Files changed: root route matcher, Users route, and work log.
- Important decisions: user routes are `/users/{username}/overview`, `/files`, and `/apps`; direct URLs select the matching user and section; `/users` defaults to the first user's overview.
- Validation: TypeScript syntax parser and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: User Apps is an empty state until per-user app assignments are implemented.

### 2026-07-17 - List all home-directory users

- Goal: Make `/users` list every directory directly under `/home`.
- Files changed: Linux users service/tests and work log.
- Important decisions: removed the `user-` prefix filter; directories without an `/etc/passwd` account are still listed with UID -1; regular files are ignored.
- Validation: targeted Go tests and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Configurable automatic Linux usernames

- Goal: Make automatic username generation optional for new Linux users.
- Files changed: settings defaults/validation/UI, user creation UI/backend/tests, and work log.
- Important decisions: `users_auto_username` defaults to false; manual usernames are required and validated when disabled; automatic names use `user-` plus eight lowercase alphanumeric characters.
- Validation: targeted Go tests, TypeScript syntax parser, and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Nested settings routes

- Goal: Give each Settings section a dedicated URL.
- Files changed: route matcher, main sidebar, Settings route, and work log.
- Important decisions: routes are `/settings/general`, `/settings/users`, and `/settings/apps`; `/settings` falls back to General Settings.
- Validation: TypeScript syntax parser and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Prefixed settings and Linux user defaults

- Goal: Rename User Settings to Users Settings and persist defaults used by Linux user creation.
- Files changed: settings database/service/API, app context, Settings route, user-add route, tests, and work log.
- Important decisions: sidebar order is General → Users → Apps; keys use `general_`, `users_`, and `apps_`; legacy keys migrate automatically; useradd uses configured shell, home base, and create-home preference.
- Validation: targeted Go tests and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - User settings and sortable app shortcuts

- Goal: Add User Settings and redesign Apps Settings for installed and pinned apps.
- Files changed: Settings route and work log.
- Important decisions: Apps Settings uses installed/header columns; pinned apps support drag/drop and accessible up/down sorting; the narrow header-pin subtitle was removed.
- Validation: `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - App header pin action

- Goal: Add or remove each app from the global header directly from its app page.
- Files changed: Apps route and work log.
- Important decisions: icon-only Pin/PinOff action sits beside service controls and uses the existing SQLite-backed `header_apps` setting.
- Validation: `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Nested app routes

- Goal: Give every app a dedicated URL such as `/apps/nginx` and `/apps/docker`.
- Files changed: route matcher, main sidebar, Header shortcuts, Apps route, and work log.
- Important decisions: `/apps` remains valid; app selection updates browser history; Back/Forward restores the selected app.
- Validation: `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - SQLite settings and app header shortcuts

- Goal: Persist panel settings and configurable app shortcuts in SQLite.
- Files changed: settings service/routes/tests, route dependencies, app context/API map, Header, Apps route, Settings route, and Go module files.
- Important decisions: default database path is `~/.mthan-vps/data/db.sqlite`; `settings` uses key/value rows; Settings sidebar includes General Settings and Apps Settings; header shortcuts are configurable per app.
- Validation: targeted Go tests and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - General settings sidebar

- Goal: Add the first Settings section with persistent app identity and appearance preferences.
- Files changed: app context, dashboard layout, color-mode utilities/switch, Settings route, and app-settings utility.
- Important decisions: Settings uses a left sidebar with `General Settings`; App Name updates the header/document title; color mode supports System, Light, and Dark and applies immediately.
- Validation: `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-17 - Post-update reload countdown

- Goal: Avoid reloading while the reverse proxy may still return a transient 502 after API restart.
- Files changed: `client/src/_layouts/_components/header.tsx`, `.agents/works.md`.
- Important decisions: wait 10 seconds after successful reconnect and update confirmation, show the countdown in the modal, then reload the window.
- Validation: `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-16 - Update reload and consolidated PHP app

- Goal: Reload safely after update reconnect and represent PHP versions as configuration of one app.
- Files changed:
  - `client/src/_layouts/_components/header.tsx`
  - `client/src/routes/apps/index.tsx`
  - `services/apps.go`
  - `services/apps_test.go`
- Important decisions:
  - Window reload occurs only after two successful health responses and update confirmation.
  - PHP is a single Apps sidebar entry; detected PHP 8.1–8.4 versions appear in its configuration panel.
  - PHP service detection is limited to services matching detected versions.
- Validation: targeted Go tests and `git diff --check`; no frontend production build.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-16 - Cross-distribution app detection

- Goal: Add Docker, Podman, Node.js, and parallel PHP versions to the Apps panel.
- Files changed:
  - `services/apps.go`
  - `services/apps_test.go`
  - `client/src/routes/apps/index.tsx`
- Important decisions:
  - Added PHP 8.1–8.4 as separate apps.
  - Detection supports Debian/Ubuntu versioned PHP-FPM names, RHEL/Remi paths and units, and Arch/RHEL generic PHP-FPM units.
  - Node.js is installation-only and does not expose system service controls.
  - Docker and Podman detect their native systemd service/socket states.
- Validation: targeted Go tests and `git diff --check` passed; frontend production build was intentionally not run for this incremental UI change.
- Known follow-up: service action buttons still use the existing client-side placeholder behavior and need a backend action endpoint before they control real services.

### 2026-07-08 - Debian RPM Arch installer support

- Goal: Update app/install docs so the service can install runtime dependencies on Debian, RPM-based systems, and Arch.
- Files changed:
  - `README.md`
  - `scripts/install.sh`
  - `.agents/works.md`
- Important decisions:
  - Kept the app's cgo/libcrypt auth implementation because Linux password login needs `crypt(3)`.
  - Added `pacman` support to install `libxcrypt-compat` on Arch Linux.
  - README now documents runtime dependency commands for Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux, and Arch Linux.
- Validation: pending.
- Known follow-up: Push updated installer and rebuilt dist binaries before testing the remote install command on fresh VPS images.

### 2026-07-08 - libcrypt runtime dependency

- Goal: Fix VPS runtime error `/usr/local/bin/mthan-vps: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypt.so.1`.
- Files changed:
  - `README.md`
  - `scripts/install.sh`
  - `.agents/works.md`
- Important decisions:
  - Kept cgo/libcrypt auth path because Linux user login verifies `/etc/shadow` hashes through `crypt(3)`.
  - Added installer check for `libcrypt.so.1`.
  - Installer now attempts to install `libcrypt1` on apt systems and `libxcrypt-compat` on dnf/yum/apk systems before starting service.
  - README now documents the runtime dependency and manual recovery command.
- Validation: pending.
- Known follow-up: Push updated installer to the distribution repo before relying on one-line remote install.

### 2026-07-08 - GitHub raw 429 install workaround

- Goal: Investigate install command failing with `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 429`.
- Files changed:
  - `README.md`
  - `scripts/install.sh`
  - `.agents/works.md`
- Important decisions:
  - Confirmed `github.com/.../raw/...` redirects to `raw.githubusercontent.com`, which returned `HTTP/2 429` from GitHub/Fastly.
  - Confirmed jsDelivr URLs returned `HTTP/2 200` for `scripts/install.sh`, `bin/mthan-vps`, and `bin/mthanctl`.
  - Updated installer default `BIN_URL` and README install commands to use jsDelivr.
- Validation:
  - `curl -I -L https://github.com/antoine-mai/mthan-tools-vps/raw/main/scripts/install.sh`
  - `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antoine-mai/mthan-tools-vps/main/scripts/install.sh | head -5`
  - `curl -I -L https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/antoine-mai/mthan-tools-vps@main/scripts/install.sh`
  - `curl -I -L https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/antoine-mai/mthan-tools-vps@main/bin/mthan-vps`
  - `curl -I -L https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/antoine-mai/mthan-tools-vps@main/bin/mthanctl`
- Known follow-up: Push changes to GitHub so the public install command uses the updated script.

### 2026-07-08 - README and installer help

- Goal: Update installation documentation to match `scripts/install.sh`.
- Files changed:
  - `README.md`
  - `scripts/install.sh`
  - `.agents/works.md`
- Important decisions:
  - Documented root install flow, installed files, root URL, `--reinstall`, environment overrides, and common systemd commands.
  - Added the same environment override details to `install.sh --help`.
- Validation: not run; documentation/help text only.
- Known follow-up: none.

### 2026-07-07 - Agent rules and handoff files

- Created `.agents/rules/project.md` with project rules for future agents.
- Created `.agents/works.md` as the shared handoff log.
- Observed pre-existing modified files:
  - `client/src/_layouts/_components/header.tsx`
  - `client/src/routes/root/users/index.tsx`
- Validation: not run; documentation-only change.

## Handoff Template

### YYYY-MM-DD - Short task title

- Goal:
- Files changed:
- Important decisions:
- Validation:
- Known follow-up:
# Public distribution layout migration

- Goal: Move the published installer to `public/install.sh` and all distribution artifacts from `bin`/`dist` into `public/dist`.
- Changed: build scripts, Makefile, development watcher exclusions, updater URLs, static-client fallbacks, README, and project rules now use the public layout.
- Validation: `bash -n` passed for build, control build, deploy, and installer scripts; `git diff --check` passed. Full builds were not run.
# VHost edit and delete actions

- Added root-only Edit and Delete actions to the Caddy VHosts table.
- Edit opens a Caddyfile modal and reloads Caddy after saving.
- Delete removes the matching top-level site block, reloads Caddy, and restores the previous file if reload fails.
# Files explorer item context menu

- Added a right-click context menu to every file and directory in the Files sidebar.
- Supports Open, directory refresh, and copying the absolute path, with viewport-aware positioning and automatic dismissal.
# Files editor color-mode support

- Replaced the FileEditor hard-coded slate dark palette with semantic theme colors.
- Empty, loading, error, binary, editor, line-number, tab, and status states now follow light and dark mode.
# Files context-menu mutations

- Added Rename and Delete for file-system items, plus New File and New Folder for directories.
- Added authenticated POST/PATCH/DELETE handlers for both root and standard-user Files routes.
- Standard-user mutations remain jailed to the resolved home path; root/home explorer nodes cannot be renamed or deleted.
# Resilient user terminals

- Added a 20-second application heartbeat so idle terminal WebSockets remain active through proxies and NAT gateways.
- Terminal tabs now detect disconnects, display connection status, and automatically reconnect to a fresh shell.
- The terminal session effect now correctly follows its target username.
